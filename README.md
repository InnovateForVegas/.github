# The Code for Vegas .github repository
Our special repo for our special organization!

While there is a codeforvegas.org website for general consumption, the Github/CodeForVegas organization is where the coolness is, right?

Let us attempt to keep a public-facing update current and useful to someone finding the org here (via our own website, or maybe from elsewhere) as to our ongoing projects and partnerships, and maybe convince people to join in and participate!

Reboot in progress...
