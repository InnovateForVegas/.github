# The Code for Vegas .github repository

Our special github repo for our special organization!

While there is a codeforvegas.org website for general consumption, the Github/CodeForVegas organization is where most code, and some non-code, project work will be stored and maintained, forever.

Let us attempt to keep a public-facing update current and useful to someone finding the org here (via our own website, or maybe from elsewhere) as to our ongoing projects and partnerships, and maybe convince people to join in and participate!

As of 16 June 2022, the Code for Vegas Foundation is a Nevada Nonprofit Corporation, which you may refer to casually as Code for Vegas and at the public website, codeforvegas.org, but which conducts business as Code for Vegas Foundation.
