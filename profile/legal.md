# Legal Status of our Organization

As of 11 December 2023:

- Our Organization is, by all accounts, one in good standing
- Amended Articles accepted with Nevada Secretary of State, our nonprofit corporation has been re-named
- Name-change letter submitted to IRS for record name change and EIN update
- Affirmation letter requested at the same time
- Updates to services, financial accounts and services, and miscellaneous can proceed on receipt of the Affirmation Letter from the IRS

## Why Rename?

The Code for Vegas Foundation has been re-named in the State of Nevada to the Innovate for Vegas Foundation, to align with our outreach to coders and non-coders alike, and to widen our separation from the legacy of Code for America (this is their preference for all brigades and former brigades and brigade-like orgs such as the original Code for Vegas).

## Donations and Finances

Our 990-N filing for our tax year ended 30 June 2023 was for our organization named *Code for Vegas Foundation*. On receipt of our Affirmation Letter, our un-changed EIN and this updated name can be used to update our bank accounts, outside services, and so on.

Until that final phase, any donations to our organization, as well as any other financial dealings, will be with our existing EIN and Nevada Business ID which have not and will not change, though our original organization name, *Code for Vegas Foundation* will continue to appear on invoices and receipts and whatnot into early 2024.

## Official Record Locations

At any time you may examine our State and Federal status regardless of our name-change status.
