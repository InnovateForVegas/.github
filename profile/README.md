# Welcome to Code for Vegas on Github!

## About the Code for Vegas Foundation

The Code for Vegas brigade as it was took a very long break beginning in
February 2016, but has as of 16 June 2022 formed as a Nevada Nonprofit
entity under the name *Code for Vegas Foundation* though you can still
call us Code for Vegas unless you are writing checks... (we do not yet
see a need to file a formal DBA).

### Governance

* President and Acting Secretary: Zach Gonzalez @ZachGonzalezz
* Director and Acting Treasurer: Dan Hugo @DanHugoDanHugo
* Director : Shawn Looker @slooker

In the mean time, our local tech and non-tech scene is as alive as
ever, which makes now a great time to get involved with making Las
Vegas and surrounding areas a great place to live or visit. One way to
do that is to join this effort and work with municipal partners and
our local communities to identify where we can make a difference, and
then make that difference happen!

This is an inclusive organization from top to bottom. In fact, you can
participate even if you have never and don't want to write Code.
Non-technical contribution to your community is not only encouraged,
but it is **essential.** If you are reading this and do not use
Github, you are still quite welcome to join in, and please share that
sentiment with your neighbors, friends, and family!

We have had several monthly, month-long projects as you read this, 
with a hackathon meetup and final presentation for each, leading to
the adding of new Projects (using github Project features, for now)
here on GitHub and likely in other useful places (Figma comes to mind).

## Projects

Each of the top-level project areas we are working on has an Overview repository
with at least a summary README.md file, including some reference links and other info.
There is a naming scheme for projects, and we use tagging to help navigate a growing collection
of repos here on GitHub. We are also exploring the use of GitHub Projects for issue tracking,

|Project                    | Description                                                                                               |
|---------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
|Open Transit               | Making it smart to move around our Smart City using open tools developed right here in and near Las Vegas |
|Open Data Capture Platform | Crowd sourced open data for our Smart City                                                                |
|Smart Social               | Tools for a Smart City to communicate with itself                                                         |
|My Vegas                   | My Vegas is the Human Interface for our Smarter Smart City                                                |
|vLocal                     | Privacy aware digital identity platform for locals                                                        |

Overview project repositories begin with **ov-** to be found more easily. All project repositories are tagged with **cfv-** prefixes in lieu of namespaces, to allow them to be grouped across various repo names.

## Join our Mailing List or This GitHub Organization

We are assembling a mailing list to keep those interested in the loop,
without needing to sign up for a Meetup or Github or some other
