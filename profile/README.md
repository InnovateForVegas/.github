We have a Discord Server for discussion and engagement with our Communities at large (those who would like to participate through discussion or perhaps just lurking), feel free to join the discussion (our actual project efforts should still take place closer to the work, mostly on GitHub).

## Renaming our Foundation

As you will read below, we have received our 501(c)(3) determination from the IRS, after which we decided to rename this foundation to better-align with inclusivity of volunteers from our greater community while also fitting in more closely with the nature of Las Vegas and surrounding areas, focused on *innovation* and entrepreneurialism.

Our legal name change in Nevada was effective on 8 September 2023. The name change with the IRS per our 990 filing will occur after that, and our EIN name change in a similar time frame, so that our financial institutions and other resources attached to our formal entity name can be updated. Please be patient through this process if you are sponsoring or donating or generally interacting with our organization wherever *Code for Vegas Foundation* appears as our entity name until all updates have completed.

## About the Innovate for Vegas Foundation

The original Code for Vegas *brigade* (before there were brigades) as it was took a very long break beginning in February 2016, but had as of 16 June 2022 re-formed as a completely independent Nevada Nonprofit entity under the name *Code for Vegas Foundation*, which is not inclusive and causes confusion for those who do not refer to what they are interested in as *code*. To be more inclusive, we have renamed ourselves as described above, though you can call us *Innovate for Vegas* if you like (unless you are writing us a check or otherwise donating to our cause, then please use the full name once the name change is complete on our accounts). Speaking of checks, we received our 501(c)(3) public charity determination letter on 12 October 2022.

### Governance

Our organization is extremely thin and all volunteer. That is, none of the people listed here, and possibly not listed here, who make our organization go, are doing so without compensation, completely on a volunteer basis.

* Managing Director: [Dan Hugo](https://github.com/DanHugoDanHugo)
* Director : [Shawn Looker](https://github.com/slooker)
* Director : [Mary Norris](https://github.com/maryfnorris)

Our local tech and non-tech scene is as alive as ever, which makes now a great time to get involved with making Las Vegas and surrounding areas a great place to live or visit. One way to do that is to join this effort and work with municipal partners and our local communities to identify where we can make a difference, and then make that difference happen!

This is an inclusive organization from top to bottom. In fact, you can participate even if you have never and don't want to write Code. Non-technical contribution to your community is not only encouraged, but it is **essential.** If you are reading this and do not use GitHub, you are still quite welcome to join in, and please share that sentiment with your neighbors, friends, and family!

Note that due to lack of participation within the Greater Vegas region, we are focusing more on remote participation from anywhere on the planet, collaborating with others to enable and encourage our values elsewhere and vice versa!

## Donations

We are a top-to-bottom volunteer organization. Those in governance and advisory roles (officers, directors, advisors, external committee members, and perhaps others) do not receive any form of salary or other compensation other than legitimate expense reimbursement where necessary. We are in this for the rewards found on the horizon.

In order to obtain supplies, food and snacks for our Monthly Hackathon Meetups, printing of business cards, cloud hosting fees outside of free tiers, and other such things, will be paid for by these very same uncompensated volunteers, or by donations from the community and beyond. Ideally these will be individuals who are interested in supporting the efforts of their own local friends and family members, though we are certainly interested in hands-off sponsorship from larger entities if there is a good fit with our goals.

Would you like to donate? Here is a hosted *donation* page at Stripe, your email address will be used to send a thank you note… we have received our 501(c)(3) determination as of 12 October 2022, so that any donation will be deductible. This is not tax advice, please consult your tax preparation professional.

**Remember**: until our legal name change is complete with the State of Nevada, and our updated name appears with the IRS associated with our EIN and 501(c)(3) status, and our various financial tools are updated to reflect our new name, you may see *Code for Vegas Foundation* and we would remind you that the update is in progress to change the one word in our name…

## Projects

Each of the top-level project areas we are working on has an Overview repository with at least a summary README.md file, including some reference links and other info. These will ideally be developed collaboratively using the Agile for Volunteers approach, ie these are not specs handed down from on high, but project goals developed by those working on and benefiting in some way from these projects (as members of our communities at large…).

There is a naming scheme for projects, and we use tagging to help navigate a growing collection of repos here on GitHub. We are also exploring the use of GitHub Projects for issue tracking,

Overview project repositories begin with **ov-** to be found more easily. All project repositories are tagged with **ifv-** prefixes in lieu of namespaces, to allow them to be grouped across various repo names.
